Hi there, I’m Akshay 🪐 aka [Astro Barnett](https://astrobarnett.in/about-me).


Do you ever wonder which is more mysterious—the infinite cosmos or the universe sitting right above our shoulders, our own mind? Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by both. My strength in physics and mathematics naturally led me to astrophysics, where I mapped galaxies, studied quasars, and unraveled patterns in the cosmos. Yet the deeper I explored the universe, the more I realized that the human brain is perhaps even more complex and enigmatic.

I’m now exploring the field of computational neuroscience, eager to bring my quantitative, computational, and modeling skills from astrophysics to understand how neural circuits compute the world and give rise to behavior. My toolkit includes Python, Jupyter Cloud, Google Cloud, and machine learning frameworks, and I enjoy experimenting with projects that bridge the cosmos and cognition.

When I’m not immersed in equations or neural networks, you can find me:

Writing poetry with a reflective, cosmic twist

Cooking and exploring new flavors

Thinking about the connections between stars and human experience

Curiosity, for me, is the bridge between seemingly distant worlds—and I love building that bridge through science, code, and creativity.

“The mind is its own universe, as mysterious and vast as the cosmos above us.”
